     <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My family's favorite weeknight friendly <strong>spaghetti</strong> recipe with an easy meat sauce is ready in 45 minutes, and <em>you can use your favorite ground meat</em>.</p>

    <p>I love pasta for quick weeknight dinners, and this spaghetti tossed with my easy homemade spaghetti sauce fits the bill! You can use any ground meat for this spaghetti recipe. I love ground turkey, but ground beef, pork, and chicken are all excellent. Of all the pasta recipes on Inspired Taste, my family makes this spaghetti the most. If you prefer meatballs over meat sauce, see our spaghetti and meatballs. I also love our delicious baked spaghetti and this quick chicken alfredo is also perfect is you feel like a creamy sauce instead.</p>
